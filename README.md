Your Inbox, just cooler

Geeks invented email in the 70s. Its presentation hasn't changed since: a list of messages, sorted by time. Sender and Subject. It should be obsolete by now, except no one has proposed anything better yet.

Let's try.

### Friends on top

It's not hard to figure out who my friends are by just looking at my mailbox: I have exchanged many emails with them over the years. Unlike most of the spam and semi-automated email I receive. Why can't my mailbox somehow highlight emails from my friends and feature them prominently?

### Built-In Chat

Have you ever had a quick chat over email, to decide something with a friend? After a few replies, the email thread typically looks like this:

  >8pm?
  >>Ok, what about the usual place?
  >>>Yes. Want to get together?
  >>>>Are you around tonight?

Why doesn't my mail program give me a chat-like interface for such discussions? They are easy to spot: short sentences. Replies that arrive quickly. So even though the underlying transport mechanism is still email, make it look like a chat window.

### Pictures

Do you know why people send email? To share pictures with people. But my email client is stuck in text mode: subject, sender... I need to open the body to see the picture. It shouldn't be that hard for the email program to tell that a friend is trying to send me a picture. If so, just show me the picture, kind of like a picture inbox.

### Kids, Travel

If an email relates to one of my kids, I want to know: newsletter from the school, email from the teacher, registration to camp, etc. There are plenty of keywords that a mail program could use to detect the topic and group my emails in a "kids folder." That folder would also be prominently featured, just like my "friends folder."

The same idea applies to more aspects of everyone's life: travel (plane ticket, hotel reservations, by destination). Parties and evites. Can't we build a smarter email client that extracts useful information and groups those emails?

### To-Do List

Some emails contain questions. Stuff I need to do. Can this somehow be highlighted? Can the mail client build an automatic to-do list, or remind me of questions I haven't replied to yet.

## You can help

You can help by sharing your own ideas. What do you wish email could do for you? File issues with your own suggestions. Vote on proposed ideas so we can figure out which ones are the most popular.

If you'd like to get more involved, our next step is to design a mock-up of what such an email interface would look like. Building something both intuitive and powerful is hard. Are you up to the challenge? Great!
